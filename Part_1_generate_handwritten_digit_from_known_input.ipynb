This means that there's no real answer for such a network to compare its output to. One such way of solving this problem, however,is to give the network a picture of a known number and let it run its weights and activations on that image, and compare the result to the original image. This set of networks does that. The first takes known images and encodes them, then decodes them to create its own images. The second takes the images that the first one makes and classifies them to verify that they are good. \n","\n","Example:\n","\n","Let's say we have an image that has 9 pixels, in a 3x3 arrangement (the numbers are the greyscale illumination of the pixels):\n","\n","[0.5][0.4][0.2]      \n","[0.7][0.3][0.9]       \n","[0.3][0.2][0.1] \n","\n","The network then runs this image through itself and this is the result:\n","\n","[0.3][0.6][0.2]      \n","[0.5][0.7][0.1]     \n","[0.9][0.4][0.0]\n","\n","This is compared back to the original image so network performance can be measured (i.e how close to the original image this really is).\n","\n","The goal of this assignment is for the neural network to geenrate pictures of digits. I have tried 2 approaches to for this, and the one I just described is the first. \n","\n","While this does work fairly well for generating images, technically it doesn't count since an image of the number is required for the network to make its own image. So we want the network to be able to generate an image from random pixels. This is explored in part 2 of this assignment.
